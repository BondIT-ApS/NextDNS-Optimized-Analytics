- PostgreSQL 15+ (for database development)

## 🚀 Quick Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/BondIT-ApS/NextDNS-Optimized-Analytics.git
cd NextDNS-Optimized-Analytics

# Setup environment
cp config/.env.template config/.env
# Edit config/.env with your development settings

# Start development stack
docker-compose up -d

## 🔄 FastAPI Migration (v1 → v2)

The backend was migrated from Flask to FastAPI v2.0 with significant improvements:

### ✅ What Changed
- **FastAPI + uvicorn** replaced Flask development server
- **Automatic API docs** at `/docs` and `/redoc`
- **Type safety** with Pydantic models
- **Enhanced logging** with configurable levels
- **Better performance** with ASGI

1. **Backend Development**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

2. **Frontend Development**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. **Database Development**
```bash
# Connect to development database
docker exec -it nextdns-db psql -U nextdns_user -d nextdns
```

## 🧪 Testing
